Error Code Description
29203	Invalid target_client_id value. This typically indicates that the client ID provided in the authorization request does not match a valid, registered application in the tenant. It may suggest misconfigured client credentials or a tampered request.
29204	Failed to write QR code token to storage. This error may result from issues with session persistence, local storage, or back-end token generation. Indicates a problem saving QR sign-in tokens.
29205	Generated QR code string exceeded allowed length. QR code data is too long, possibly due to excessive session metadata or misconfiguration. Sign-in fails due to payload size limitations.
29206	Invalid QR code redemption request: client ID invalid. The request to redeem the QR code contains a clientId that isn’t authorized or doesn’t exist in the tenant. May indicate a rogue or deprecated client.
29207	Error processing session data: QR code invalid or expired. The QR code might be outdated or was tampered with. Often seen in mobile sign-ins where timing is critical.
29208	QR code already redeemed. This is a replay attack prevention mechanism. A QR code can only be used once; re-use attempts trigger this error.
29210	QR code sign-in is disabled by policy. Sign-in via QR codes is restricted by an organization’s user credential policy. This is expected behavior if QR is intentionally blocked.
29211	QR code sign-in unsupported for passthrough users. Users authenticated via pass-through authentication (PTA) are not eligible for QR-based sign-in. Indicates enforcement of hybrid identity model constraints.
29212	QR code sign-in not supported for consumer scenarios. Personal (MSA) accounts or B2C contexts do not support QR sign-in, which is enterprise-only.
40002	Identity provider (IdP) returned an error: Status = {status}, Message = {message}. The federated IdP (e.g., ADFS, third-party SAML) failed to complete the request. Check the IdP logs for the root cause.
40003	Required token not emitted by external IdP. The external IdP did not return a necessary security assertion (e.g., SAML token, JWT). Might be due to misconfiguration or user attribute filtering.
40004	Required token not emitted by external IdP. Duplicate of 40003, used in slightly different flow contexts. Still indicates a missing token from an external source.
40005	Invalid token from external IdP. The received token has timing mismatches—either expired or with incorrect timestamps. Ensure clock sync between systems and validate token lifetimes.
40008	Unexpected error from external IdP. Generic federation error from an unknown issue in the third-party IdP. Further investigation required at the IdP side.
40009	Identity provider returned a general error. Non-specific federation failure. Could be caused by bad configurations, service issues, or incorrect claim rules.
40010	Transient error from IdP. Temporary issue at the IdP end. Usually resolves with retry. Monitor for repeated occurrences that could indicate a systemic issue.
